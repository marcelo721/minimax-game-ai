# Minimax Board Game AI

This project implements an Artificial Intelligence (AI) agent to play **Tic-Tac-Toe** and **Checkers** using the **Minimax algorithm**. The AI is designed to simulate intelligent gameplay by evaluating possible future moves and choosing the optimal strategy.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language used for logic implementation.
- **Pygame**: Used for rendering the graphical interface and handling game interactions.

## Features

- üéÆ **Tic-Tac-Toe AI**: Plays optimally using Minimax, ensuring either a win or a draw.
- ‚ôüÔ∏è **Checkers AI**: More complex Minimax implementation with recursive tree evaluation for multi-step strategies.
- üß† **Minimax Algorithm**: Used in both games to recursively evaluate all possible game states up to a certain depth.
- üñ±Ô∏è Interactive GUI built with Pygame.



- The focus of this project is the AI logic, not advanced graphics or animations.
- The Checkers AI may have a limited depth for performance reasons.
- Pygame is required to run the graphical interface.
