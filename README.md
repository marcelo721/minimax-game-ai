# Minimax Board Game AI

This project implements an Artificial Intelligence (AI) agent to play **Tic-Tac-Toe**, **Checkers**, and **Connect Four** using the **Minimax algorithm**. The AI is designed to simulate intelligent gameplay by evaluating possible future moves and choosing the optimal strategy.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language used for logic implementation.
- **Pygame**: Used for rendering the graphical interface and handling game interactions.

## Features

- 🎮 **Tic-Tac-Toe AI**: Plays optimally using Minimax, ensuring either a win or a draw.
- ♟️ **Checkers AI**: More complex Minimax implementation with recursive tree evaluation for multi-step strategies.
- 🔴 **Connect Four AI**: Implements Minimax with depth control and heuristic evaluation for strategic decision-making.
- 🧠 **Minimax Algorithm**: Used in all games to recursively evaluate game states and select the best possible move.
- 🖱️ Interactive GUI built with Pygame.

> ⚠️ Notes:
> - The focus of this project is the AI logic, not advanced graphics or animations.
> - The Checkers and Connect Four AIs may use limited depth search for performance reasons.
> - Pygame is required to run the graphical interface.
